# QUICKPLOT and Delft3D-MATLAB interface
QUICKPLOT is a post processing tool for the [Delft3D 4](https://www.deltares.nl/en/software-and-data/products/delft3d-4-suite) and [Delft3D FM](https://www.deltares.nl/en/software-and-data/products/delft3d-flexible-mesh-suite) Suites.
It has been programmed in the [MATLAB](https://nl.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) language and the source functions as such also a Delft3D-MATLAB interface for working with Delft3D data from within the MATLAB environment.
QUICKPLOT does not only support Delft3D data files but a wide variety of other file formats that one may encounter in environmental modelling.
For details, see the [QUICKPLOT user manual](https://content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d4/Delft3D-QUICKPLOT_User_Manual.pdf) and the [Delft3D-MATLAB user manual](https://content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d4/Delft3D-MATLAB_User_Manual.pdf).

# Repository structure
The QUICKPLOT source code was from 2011 until 2025 included in the Delft3D 4 source code repository.
The current folder structure is a consequence of that period.
It may change in the future, but we keep it as is for our internal automated testing and build processes.
